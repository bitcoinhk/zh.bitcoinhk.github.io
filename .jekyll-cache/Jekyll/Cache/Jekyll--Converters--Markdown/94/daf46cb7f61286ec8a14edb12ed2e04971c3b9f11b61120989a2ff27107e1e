<p>Over seven years into the emergence of the Bitcoin Blockchain, we increasingly ask ourselves how much, if anything, lies beyond the use case of a decentralized and volatile digital currency that alienates regulators and the financial industry alike. Jack C Liu of OKLink speaks about what he sees for Bitcoin, time stamping and settlement systems.</p>

<p>About the speaker: Jack is a serial entrepreneur founding businesses in Silicon Valley, Beijing, and Hong Kong. He has led OKCoin’s international exchange since 2014 and co-created OKLink transfer network and the Bihang blockchain wallet.

Jack began his career in Hong Kong at Barclays in Equity Derivatives and is a graduate of Queen’s University.</p>
