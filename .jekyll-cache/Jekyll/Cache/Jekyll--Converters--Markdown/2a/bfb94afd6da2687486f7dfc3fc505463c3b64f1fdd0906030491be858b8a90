I"Û<p>Several of the attendees of this weekâ€™s Inside Bitcoins conference will be taking a trip to
Macau to meet up with some Macau bitcoiners and members of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/753083674762937/">Macau Digital Currency Association</a>.</p>

<p>Macau has one of the densest Bitcoin atm networks in the world with 6 in the 12 square mile
territory and lots of great food and culture, so itâ€™s definitely worth the 60 minute
boat trip for any Bitcoiners visiting from out of town!</p>

<p>This is a last minute event and exact details (time &amp; itinenary) are TDB, so please join the <a href="https://telegram.me/joinchat/APsfyAD7wYRzf8a2OzlXKQ">Telegram
chat group</a> if youâ€™re interested in going.</p>
