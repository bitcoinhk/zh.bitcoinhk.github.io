<p>About the topic:</p>

<p>Shared ledger technologies promise to create a new age of the consortium. There is significant potential to reduce transaction and record-keeping costs, streamline business operations and enable new business models by using shared ledger technologies.</p>

<p>However, early investigations and attempts at adapting the public blockchain to these types of commercial relationships have identified a number of limitations. In particular, the transparent, decentralised model of public blockchain significantly compromises the commercial confidentiality required.</p>

<p>How are commercial consortia better suited to modify or reconstruct versions of blockchain technology? George Samman explains.</p>

<p>This is a free event, capacity is limited.</p>
