<p>The Fintech O2O initiative began in 2015 as a monthly meet up in Hong Kong, co-organized by Cyberport and NexChange. The idea was simple â€“ bring together like-minded professionals who recognize the impact of technology on traditional finance to network and discuss pressing topics. The initiative has welcomed 2,000+ professionals from 20+ countries.</p>

<p>Now in its second year, the initiative has grown into a global series with events planned in New York, London, Toronto and Shanghai.</p>

<p>To continue to serve the community in Hong Kong and globally, Fintech O2O is setting the stage for its first multi-day conference.</p>
