<p>Speaker:</p>

<p><strong>Peter Ng</strong></p>

<p>The Bitcoin Blockchain relies on proof-of-work for security. This technologically relatively simple process is known to be highly competitive and energy consuming. Centralization fears and its environmental impact have discredited Bitcoin’s security model, while alternatives haven’t been able to establish themselves yet.</p>

<p>In this talk, Peter Ng shares his experience on running more than 40 industrial-sized mining sites, and his views on the future of cryptocurrency mining. All up, Peter manages 250 MW, enough to power around 200,000 average US homes.</p>

<p>No fee. Limited seats are available, please don’t forget to RSVP!</p>
