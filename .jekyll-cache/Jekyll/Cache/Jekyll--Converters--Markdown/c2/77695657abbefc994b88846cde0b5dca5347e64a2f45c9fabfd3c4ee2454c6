I"å<p>Please join Ethereum Founder, World Technology Award winner and Peter Thiel Fellow Vitalik Buterin for a discussion on the impact of Blockchain on the Financial Industry. In recent months a flood of banks have actively and publicly engaged with Blockchain technology, setting up internal research teams, their own test coins (Citicoin) or partnering with commercial distributed ledger solutions like R3CEV (including Goldman, UBS, JP Morgan). 
Is this proof of worth for the cryptocurrency pioneers? Or does this signal the beginning of the end for the anti-bank beginnings of crypto? Join Vitalik Buterin with a moderated Q&amp;A by Jehan Chu for a 2hr session on what the opportunities are for the big banks and the bigger picture.</p>
