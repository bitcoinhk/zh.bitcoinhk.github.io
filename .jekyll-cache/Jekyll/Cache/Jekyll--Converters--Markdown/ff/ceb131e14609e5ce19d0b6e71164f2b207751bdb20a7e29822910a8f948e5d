<p>Today’s contracts are difficult enough to read for most humans, who barely skip through them even on the matter of life and death. How can contracts become smarter, machine readable and self-enforcable? Two talks explore what is possible today, and give an outlook more science than fiction.</p>

<p><strong>First lecture, Dr. Joseph Wang &amp; Max Jackowski:</strong>
Presenting a machine readable, legally enforcable contract that facilitates loans for small businesses cheaper and more flexible than any bank could. This contract is already used in a number of loans in Hong Kong today and ready to scale up for the emerging p2p (or rather, p2b) lending platforms.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Max is a postgraduate student at the Faculty of Law at the University of Hong Kong. His research focuses on the relationship between the law and disruptive technologies. He has developed great interest in the subject of smart contracts as it provides for a novel and innovative way of understanding, analysing and enforcing the law</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr. Joseph Wang is investment banker and chief scientist for Bitquant
Research Laboratories (Asia) Limited, an applied research financial
technology laboratory.  He is using smart contracts to issue loans to
high-tech SME’s in Hong Kong and is developing digital currency for
trade with Africa.  He claims to be the first person to use a smart
contract for a real world business transaction.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Second lecture, Pindar Wong:</strong>
While today’s smart contracts still rely on our existing legal system for enforcement, future smart contracts will become self-executing, unforgeable and impossible to cheat on.</p>
