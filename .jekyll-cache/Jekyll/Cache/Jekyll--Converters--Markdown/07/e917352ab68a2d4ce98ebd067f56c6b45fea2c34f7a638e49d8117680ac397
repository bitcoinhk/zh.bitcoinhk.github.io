<p>Tangem is a NFC hardware wallet. Each tangem note contains a NFC chip with a secure element. While more advanced and secure, it is similar in functionality to your Octopus card. The chip contains the private key to a Bitcoin address. This private key cannot be extracted from the card.</p>

<p>You can use an NFC-enabled smart phone to verify the authenticity of the Tangem note, check its balance and send or receive Bitcoin.
