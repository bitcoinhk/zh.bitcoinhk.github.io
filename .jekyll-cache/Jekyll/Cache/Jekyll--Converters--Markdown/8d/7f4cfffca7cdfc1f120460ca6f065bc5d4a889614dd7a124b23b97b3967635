<p>Blockchains scale poorly. Both Ethereum and Bitcoin have trouble scaling at their current throughput of just 2-7 transactions per second, multiple magnitudes away from the peaks that Visa or Alipay are able to handle.</p>

<p>The envisioned solution are networks built on top of the basis blockchain that allow for high frequency payments between participants, removing any upper limit on the transaction capability of a blockchain, lowering transaction costs significantly and making microtransactions feasible. Andr√©s G. Aragoneses, VP or Engineering at Gatecoin explains the functionality of the Lightning and Raiden Networks in the 18th edition of the TGN Bitcoin Lecture Series.</p>
