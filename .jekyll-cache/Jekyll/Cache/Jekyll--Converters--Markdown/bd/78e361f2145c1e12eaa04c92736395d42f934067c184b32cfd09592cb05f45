<p>The Bitcoin Devs meetup is a technical event intended for programmers, developers and technical people curious, interested and knowledgeable about the Bitcoin protocol to catch up, discuss and socialize.</p>

<p>Special guest: <a href="https://twitter.com/larrysalibra/"><strong>Larry Salibra</strong></a>, engineering partner at <a href="https://blockstack.org/">Blockstack</a>, will explain how to build a name system on top of Bitcoin.</p>

<p>The Blockstack Name System (BNS) is a replacement for DNS that runs as a layer 2 application on top of Bitcoin. Larry will cover the details of BNS, including its move from Namecoin and its implementation as a state machine on an underlying blockchain.</p>

<p>BNS finds application in identity and authentication, app discovery and multi-player storage.</p>
