<p>Shenzhen also has an active and vibrant Bitcoin industry, and we are very happy that their community merges with Hong Kongâ€™s whenever we can.</p>

<p>We are very happy to get the chance to head over as well for a fun afternoon at Willyâ€™s Crab Shack in Shekou with delicious food and drinks.</p>

<p>And yes, they will be accepting Bitcoin for the day!</p>

<p>If you want to join in on getting to Shenzhen with us or need help coordinating your arrival, you can always reach us in our <a href="https://telegram.me/joinchat/AU21xQCpNZwVa204QX5pQw">Shenzhen Shenanigans Telegram group</a>.</p>
