<p>The acceleration of Ethereumâ€™s adoption has spread from tech to finance to government and beyond. The landscape changes even faster than many of us can keep up with, but we are still only at phase 2 of 4 with Homestead with Metropolis and Serenity yet to come.</p>

<p>Please join Vitalik Buterin, inventor and co-founder of Ethereum with a view on where we are and where weâ€™re going now. Followed by discussion and Q&amp;A moderated by Jehan Chu.</p>

<p><em>Please note that this talk may start later than 7:30pm as Vitalik will only be landing in HK at 6:30pm</em></p>

<p><strong>Many thanks to KPMG for kindly hosting and video recording this event</strong></p>
