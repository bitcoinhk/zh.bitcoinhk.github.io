<p>Money has taken different forms throughout history: sea shells, beads, gold and silver, cigarettes, paper dollars, etc. Regardless of the form, the purpose of money is generally to fulfill three basic functions:  a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and / or a store of value. Now, in the digital age of communication, global e-commerce, and big data, is it possible that the next form of currency will be entirely digital, as well? Not just a digital exchange of paper money, but actual, fully digital currency? Join fellow graduate students and professionals at this Futurist Forum to gain an understanding of what cryptocurrency is, and learn about the current and future applications of Bitcoin.</p>
