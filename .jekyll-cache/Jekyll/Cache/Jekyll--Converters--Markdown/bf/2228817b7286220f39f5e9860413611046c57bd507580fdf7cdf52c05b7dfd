<p>Updated: January 30, 2018</p>

<p>While Bitcoin has not been able to establish itself as a generally accepted method of payment just yet, support has steadily increased especially among online merchants. Hong Kong especially is still largely a cash-driven society, with Octopus being the only electronic payment system to establish itself outside of the bars and upscale restaurants of Hong Kong island.</p>

<p>But Bitcoin has become widely recognized in certain niches for online payments, such as the sale of gift cards, prepaid value, online gaming, gambling and privacy conscious products such as VPNs.</p>

<p>Why do merchants in Hong Kong accept Bitcoin?
We have reached out to Hong Kong online merchants of various industries and asked them why. Here are their enthusiastic or even sobering responses:</p>

<p>Sean:
“It just seemed silly not to, it’s a frictionless online payment system that works like cash. Credit cards charge 3%+ and as a startup/small business every cent counts. I wish all of our customers would use bitcoin.”

<h2 id="wedding-gifts">Wedding Gifts</h2>

<p>“As a supplier of gifts to customers worldwide, bitcoin offers lower fees and global reach”

<p>“In addition to lower fees and no charge back, we gain access to more customers from countries that are currently not supported by our payment processor.”

<p>Jack:
“As we have quite a lot of international customers using our photography services, we would like to provide one more way for them to pay. Bitcoin is great in a sense that it has low transaction cost, safe and fast. We strongly recommend that to other business owners.”

<p>Larry*:
“It’s not actually that great for us, given that it doesn’t allow us to do recurring payments, but for high risk transactions it’s perfect.”

<h2 id="too-free-to-fail">Too Free To Fail</h2>

<p>Leo*:
“Bitcoin is the only method of payment we accept for our SIM cards. In fact, we wouldn’t be able to sell these cards online if it weren’t for Bitcoin, as we can not take care of the risk of charge backs and defaults.”
