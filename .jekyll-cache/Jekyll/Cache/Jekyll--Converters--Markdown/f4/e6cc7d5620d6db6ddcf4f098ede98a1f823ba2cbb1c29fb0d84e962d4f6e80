  <li>How the Bitcoin system works and what makes it secure,</li>
  <li>How Bitcoin addresses and ‘wallets’ work,</li>
  <li>What bitcoin ‘forks’ are and how to survive one,</li>
  <li>What’s the difference between Bitcoin and all these other things we keep hearing about such as Altcoins and ICOs?</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking the first step into Bitcoin can be daunting. You’ll learn how to do things safely and not mess it up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to buy (and sell) Bitcoin,</li>
  <li>How to store Bitcoin,</li>
  <li>How to transfer Bitcoin to other addresses (or people)</li>
</ul>

<p>Workshop</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get help with setting up your first wallet.</li>
  <li>Set up ‘cold storage’ where you can safely store Bitcoin long term.</li>
  <li>Send and receive Bitcoin without ever exposing your wallet to an internet connection where it may be exposed to hackers or malware.</li>
</ul>
