<p>Michael Flaxman, CEO of CoinSafe and who worked on BlockCypher will be visiting Hong Kong from his native Seattle and offered to do a talk on Bitcoin and the Bitcoin protocol oriented towards software engineers (but open to anyone with a technical mindset).</p>

<p>Heâ€™ll be going over hash functions and public/private key crypto, and how theyâ€™re used to secure and store the blockchain. Michael has built 3 venture-funded companies that have raised over $100MM USD combined. He built a block explorer that can predict transaction confirmation at live.blockcypher.com and has made security contributions to Vitalik Buterinâ€™s pybitcointools, Steve Bussâ€™ bitmerchant and Richard Kissâ€™ pycoin.</p>

<p>Hosted by Leonhard Weese, President of the Bitcoin Association of HK (bitcoinhk.org). Please help spread the word to the programmer/engineer community, and see you there!</p>
