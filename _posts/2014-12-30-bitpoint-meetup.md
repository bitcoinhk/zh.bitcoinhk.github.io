Great turnout at the last Hong Kong Bitcoin meetup of 2014. Stacy Herbert and Max Keiser, who were in town filming episodes of their RT show [Keiser Report](http://rt.com/shows/keiser-report/) also dropped by and shared their great knowledge of Bitcoin, Media and World Finance with us.
See you all again in 2015! Stay update about our meetings through our [Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-HK/).
