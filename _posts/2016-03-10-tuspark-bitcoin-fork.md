### #10, March 10: The Looming Hard Fork

On Sunday morning, February 21 2016, developers of Bitcoin Core and representatives of Bitcoin miners gathered at Cyberport in Hong Kong and [agreed to hard fork](https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/bitcoin-roundtable-consensus-266d475a61ff) the Bitcoin protocol by July 2017.    
Meanwhile, representatives of Bitcoin Classic continue to pursue miners and users to switch to their version of the Bitcoin protocol, threatening to split the network if at least 75% of the hashing power agrees.    
What does it mean to hard fork Bitcoin? Can anybody do it, and what risks does it entail? Are funds at risk, and what happens when there are two blockchains?
