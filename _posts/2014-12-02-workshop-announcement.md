## Workshop: Information Security

Stay in control of your data and identity.

Your email, images, chats and calls are handed through the hands of various companies and governments before they arrive at their destination. But security is not a cryptoanarchic dream. Software exists that can help us reclaim our privacy, and it is not difficult to use. Learn how.

Speakers: Fabian Lischka, Larry Salibra, Leonhard Weese
