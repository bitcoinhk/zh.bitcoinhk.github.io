Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks is a government-funded business park focusing on technology companies of all kind. Their “Incu-App” program is an incubator for web- and mobile applications, providing infrastructure, support and funding for start-ups in their earliest stage.

Around 30 people attended the mingling session for startups at Science Park Hong Kong under the theme “cryptocurrencies” on October 28, 2014. Gatecoin is one of the many companies incubated at the Incu-App center. Their CEO Aurelien Menant (also a founding member of the Bitcoin Association) presented bitcoin and his exchange in this sharing session to the fellow incubatees and guests from around the park.

Leonhard Weese gave a talk on why Bitcoin matters for Start-ups. The low barrier to get started (literally just an apt-get away), being able to lower the costs when outsourcing small work and automating payments and accounting were the primary advantages outlined in the talk.
