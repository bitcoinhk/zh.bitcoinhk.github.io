## Bitcoin for Software Engineers with Michael Flaxman

Michael Flaxman, CEO of CoinSafe and who worked on BlockCypher will be visiting Hong Kong from his native Seattle and offered to do a talk on Bitcoin and the Bitcoin protocol oriented towards software engineers (but open to anyone with a technical mindset). 

He'll be going over hash functions and public/private key crypto, and how they're used to secure and store the blockchain. Michael has built 3 venture-funded companies that have raised over $100MM USD combined. He built a block explorer that can predict transaction confirmation at live.blockcypher.com and has made security contributions to Vitalik Buterin's pybitcointools, Steve Buss' bitmerchant and Richard Kiss' pycoin.

Hosted by Leonhard Weese, President of the Bitcoin Association of HK (bitcoinhk.org). Please help spread the word to the programmer/engineer community, and see you there!
