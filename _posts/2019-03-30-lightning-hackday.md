## Lightning Hackday

The Lightning Network is a network of payment channels that already make it possible to send small amounts of Bitcoin to any participant around the globe. It is decentralized, permissionless and free and open source.

The Lightning Network opens up new possibilities for online payments and the way we think of Bitcoin. In many ways it functions differently to how we are used to Bitcoin, and there are plenty of new things to learn.

The Lightning Hackday is a two-day event for technologists, developers and those who want to be at the forefront of this new technology.

Anybody is welcome, and we'll be offering workshops, demos and talks for all skill sets and levels of expertise.

[You can get a ticket for the event here.](https://lightning.bitcoin.org.hk/register)

Lunch and dinner will be provided for those with a ticket.
