## 3rd Satoshi Square

The first Satoshi Square in Hong Kong was held in November 2013. Satoshi Square is to show Bitcoin's peer-to-peer nature and how easy it is to get your first coins. No matter if you want to buy or sell, mingle or just get set up with your first wallet, at this event you will find the right peers. We will meet at the Terrace on the fourth floor of Hysan Place in Causeway Bay, above exit F. You are free to bring your own drinks and snacks to the terrace.
