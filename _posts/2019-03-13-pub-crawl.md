## Lunar New Year Party

More than 2,000 guests are expected for Token2049, primarily from overseas. We welcome you to mingle with all of us at a massive Pub Crawl around Soho.

Each station is its own Meetup. You can head straight to the station you are interested in the most or visit them in any order, for as long or often as you like.
