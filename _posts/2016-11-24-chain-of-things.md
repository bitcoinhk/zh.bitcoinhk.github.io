## Chain of Things

Chain of Things is hosting a unique event on how the future of shipping can leverage blockchain and IoT. We are currently researching a new approach to a bills of lading protocol. Participation is encouraged and open to all partners. The study will culminate with a presentation at our event in November. Please follow the [link to register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/chain-of-lading-the-future-of-shipping-blockchain-and-iot-tickets-27744838559).
