## Bitcoin for Software Engineers with Michael Flaxman

Coinarch would like to meet you for food and drinks and host a session on bitcoin trading.

The bitcoin market has proven to be extremely volatile, with the price known to swing 15% or more in one day. Volatility equals opportunity and the introduction of bitcoin trading products allow investors to profit in rising, falling or sideways markets. Mark Hergott, Co Founder of Coinarch, will present on how every day bitcoin enthusiasts can profit from bitcoin. Mark will cover:

- The opportunity to trading bitcoin 
- How to play 
- What can go wrong
