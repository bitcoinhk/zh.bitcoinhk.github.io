## Virtual Bitcoin Halving Party

This event will be held virtually. Anyone is free to join the 21h live stream.

When Bitcoin was created, miners were awarded 50 bitcoin per block. Every 210,000 blocks (roughly four years) this block subsidy is dropped in half. Around May 12, we this amount will be 'halved' for the third time to 6.25 BTC. [You can read more about the halving here.](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-the-halvening)

We invite you to join this commemoration [with our friends from Bitcoin Magazine and all over the world](https://www.bitcoinhalving.com/speakers). You can submit your own content ideas [here](https://www.bitcoinhalving.com/submission), too.
