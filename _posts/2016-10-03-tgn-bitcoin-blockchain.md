### #14, October 5: What Is The Blockchain Good For?

Date: **October 5, 2016 19:00 - 21:00**     
Location: Tuspark Workhub, 23/F Island Beverly, **1 Great George Street, Causeway Bay**, Hong Kong     
(Around the corner from **Exit E, Causeway Bay Station**)     

Over seven years into the emergence of the Bitcoin Blockchain, we increasingly ask ourselves how much, if anything, lies beyond the use case of a decentralized and volatile digital currency that alienates regulators and the financial industry alike. Jack C Liu of OKLink speaks about what he sees for Bitcoin, time stamping and settlement systems.

About the speaker: Jack is a serial entrepreneur founding businesses in Silicon Valley, Beijing, and Hong Kong. He has led OKCoin's international exchange since 2014 and co-created OKLink transfer network and the Bihang blockchain wallet. Jack has appeared on Bloomberg TV, Financial Times, New York Times, Coindesk and more. Jack began his career in Hong Kong at Barclays in Equity Derivatives and is a graduate of Queen's University.

This is a free event, capacity is limited.
