## Bitcoin Meetup

Sadly our Kowloon venue is unexpectedly closing. We'll host this meetup in Central instead. Apologies for the inconvenience!

Lightning payments accepted!
We meet once a month at The Crescent Moon to hang out, chat and connect.

Craft Brew & Co is located on Staunton Street, just off the escalators and next to Tai Kwun.
