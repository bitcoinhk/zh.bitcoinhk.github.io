## Fintech O-2-O Global Summit

The Fintech O2O initiative began in 2015 as a monthly meet up in Hong Kong, co-organized by Cyberport and NexChange. The idea was simple â€“ bring together like-minded professionals who recognize the impact of technology on traditional finance to network and discuss pressing topics. The initiative has welcomed 2,000+ professionals from 20+ countries.

Now in its second year, the initiative has grown into a global series with events planned in New York, London, Toronto and Shanghai.

To continue to serve the community in Hong Kong and globally, Fintech O2O is setting the stage for its first multi-day conference.
