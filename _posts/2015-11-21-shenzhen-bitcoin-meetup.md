## Shenzhen Bitcoin Meetup

Shenzhen also has an active and vibrant Bitcoin industry, and we are very happy that their community merges with Hong Kong's whenever we can. 

We are very happy to get the chance to head over as well for a fun afternoon at Willy's Crab Shack in Shekou with delicious food and drinks.

And yes, they will be accepting Bitcoin for the day!

If you want to join in on getting to Shenzhen with us or need help coordinating your arrival, you can always reach us in our [Shenzhen Shenanigans Telegram group](https://telegram.me/joinchat/AU21xQCpNZwVa204QX5pQw).
