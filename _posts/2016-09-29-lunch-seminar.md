New technologies are pushing the boundaries of transformational change in the economy at a global level.

The event will focus on the analysis of tax and legal implications for HK companies operating in the digital currencies and blockchain industries. The speakers will navigate the audience through the currently available regulatory framework while presenting a number of case studies of HK fintech startups.
