### #21, May 11: Blockchain Forks - What happens when the network splits

Date: **May 11, 2017 19:00 - 21:00**     
Location: Garage Society, 9/F, **33 Des Voeux Road Central, Central**, Hong Kong     
(Around the corner from **Exit C, Hong Kong Station** or **Exit B, Central Station**)     

Speaker: **Leo Weese**

To upgrade a blockchain is hard, everyone has to agree on the new set of rules, or else the network risks to split into two. This talk explains the variety of upgrade mechanisms that exist, their advantages and disadvantages, as well as what risk they bring to miners and users in both the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.

This is a free event.
