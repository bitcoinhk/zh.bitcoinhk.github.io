### #16, November 23: Shared Ledgers and the Age of the Consortia

Date: **November 23, 2016 19:00 - 21:00**     
Location: Tuspark Workhub, 4/F Yes & Right House, **1 Mody Road, Tsim Sha Tsui**, Hong Kong     
(Near **Exit N5, Tsim Sha Tsui Station**)     

After HKMA released their "Whitepaper on Distributed Ledger Technology" the TGN Bitcoin Lecture Series takes a look at these shared ledgers and the age of consortia.

Speaker: **George Samman**

About the speaker:

George is a blockchain and cryptocurrency consultant and advisor to global financial institutions, startups and law firms. He recently co-authored a seminal report on blockchain architecture with [KPMG](https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2016/06/kpmg-blockchain-consensus-mechanism.pdf) and worked with Brian Kelly Capital Management to re-architect [Nautiluscoin into PAR](http://par.io/whitepaper.pdf). 
George co-founded BTC.sx, now magnr, a bitcoin trading platform in 2013. He writes at [sammantics.com](http://sammantics.com/).

About the topic:

Shared ledger technologies promise to create a new age of the consortium. There is significant potential to reduce transaction and record-keeping costs, streamline business operations and enable new business models by using shared ledger technologies.

However, early investigations and attempts at adapting the public blockchain to these types of commercial relationships have identified a number of limitations. In particular, the transparent, decentralised model of public blockchain significantly compromises the commercial confidentiality required.

How are commercial consortia better suited to modify or reconstruct versions of blockchain technology? George Samman explains.

This is a free event, capacity is limited.
