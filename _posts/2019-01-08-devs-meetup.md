## Let's Talk About Code

The Bitcoin Devs meetup is a technical event intended for programmers, developers and technical people curious, interested and knowledgeable about the Bitcoin protocol to catch up, discuss and socialize.

Topic: A cryptographic protocol for provably fair poker. We'll look at the implementation of this protocol and demo the world's first provably fair bitcoin poker game.

Special guest: Daniel Babbev, bitcoiner, software developer and cryptographer from Bulgaria.

Please be aware that our venue has a very limited capacity. Please RSVP early and don't forget to update if you cannot make it.
