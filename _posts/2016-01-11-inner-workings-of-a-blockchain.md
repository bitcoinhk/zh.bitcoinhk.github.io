### #8, October 14: The Inner Workings of a Blockchain (lecture)

Private and public keys, hash functions, nodes and proof of work might sound like foreign concepts, but are far easier to understand in their entirety than credit cards and bank accounts. This workshop is light on math and goes step by step through what keeps Blockchain Technology so reliable, secure and decentralized. There will be plenty of times for your questions.
