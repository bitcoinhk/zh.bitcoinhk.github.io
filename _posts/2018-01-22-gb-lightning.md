### Lightning Network Demo

Date: **January 22, 2018 19:00 - 21:00**     
Location: Genesis Block, 1/F, Kwong Wah Building, **269-273 Hennessy Road**, Wan Chai, Hong Kong

Speaker:

**Leo Weese** (Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong)

The Lightning Network promises decentralized, instant and cheap transactions on top of the Bitcoin network. Without explaining too much how it works in the background we will be demoing the Lightning App, create channels and chat about how and whether this technology can turn Bitcoin into a serious Visa and Mastercard competitor.

Set up your own wallet before or during the event if you want to join the fun!
