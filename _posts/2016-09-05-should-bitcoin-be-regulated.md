## Bitcoin and Blockchain assets - Should they be regulated?

In the wake of several large-scale cryptocurrency heists in recent months, coupled with the ever-increasing hype around blockchain, several regulators across the world are in active discussions towards defining and regulating both the technology and its applications.  Regulation provides clarity and guidelines to the startups and established firms innovating with the technology and is welcomed by many companies that wish to do business with other regulated entities such as banks, asset managers, and payment services. 
On the other hand, many players in the space believe that regulation contradicts the decentralized nature of the technology, or at least how it was initially envisioned, and prefer to conduct activities outside of regulatory supervision. 
Join us on September 5th to hear from two Hong Kong based bitcoin and blockchain asset exchanges with opposing views on regulation and find out about the challenges faced by the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong in their efforts to lobby local regulators. 
Whether you’re a bitcoin believer, blockchain enthusiast or just curious about the technology, bring an open mind and plenty of questions!
