## On Investing: A conversation with Professor and Angel Investor Dr. David Lee

Please join Professor and veteran Blockchain Angel investor Dr. David Lee in dialogue with Jehan Chu (Partner, Jen Advisors) on the past, present, and future state of investing in Blockchain. From traditional direct investments in startup companies, the rapidly increasing number of investment funds, to the highly volatile world of cryptocurrency trading, we will discuss how the old rules of investing still apply, and why they may desperately need to evolve. 


Presented by Ethereum HK, Bitcoin Association of HK, Metta HK, and with support from Jen Advisors.
