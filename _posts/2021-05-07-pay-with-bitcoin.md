### For consumers

Paying with Bitcoin helps you to understand how Bitcoin works and doesn't work. Using a cryptocurrency is an important part of 'do your own research' and helps reaffirm our beliefs and expectations. We especially recommend to try out Lightning transactions, as they are instantaneous and cheap.
