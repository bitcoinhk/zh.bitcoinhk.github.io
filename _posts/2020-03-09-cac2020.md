## [Crypto Assets Conference 2020](https://crypto-assets-conference.de/)

On 9/10 March 2020, the Frankfurt School Blockchain Center is organizing the Crypto Asset Conference on the campus of the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management for the third time. Blockchain technology was born through the invention of Bitcoin and has since then created hundreds of digital assets and spurred the development of business models building on decentralized networks. The conference covers both the public blockchain (crypto assets) and the enterprise blockchain domain (DLT). CAC20 makes the audience familiar with the current trends in DLT, blockchain and crypto assets:
 
- Custody of digital assets, Bitcoin and other crypto assets, token protocols, decentralized finance (DeFi)
- Blueprint DLT-based capital market, tokenized securities, securitized tokens (ETFs)
- Digital euro, tokenizations of cash flows, machine-2-machine payment processes
- Investors’/VCs preferences, security tokens
- Regulatory developments in Germany (new crypto law, blockchain strategy) and the Liechtenstein Blockchain Act.
