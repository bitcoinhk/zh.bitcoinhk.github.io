## Workshop: Information Security

Encryption powers the tools we use to secure not just our Bitcoins, but our communications and files. These tools can be incredibly liberating, but they can also be confusing and difficult to use or differentiate.

[Fabian Lischka](http://fabian-lischka.de/), [Larry Salibra](https://www.larrysalibra.com/) and [Leonhard Weese](https://liongrass.hk/) explained on December 4, 2014 at the Hive to journalists how to secure their accounts and protect their online identities, communicate securely and privately with sources and stay on top of their research.

The provided handout can be found [here](https://discuss.bitcoinhk.org/uploads/default/179/bc29633c2d7db55a.pdf).
