## Let's Talk About Code


The Bitcoin Devs meetup is a technical event intended for programmers, developers and technical people curious, interested and knowledgeable about the Bitcoin protocol to catch up, discuss and socialize.

Special guest: **Eric Voskuil**, lead developer of [Libbitcoin](https://libbitcoin.org/), a free and open source high performance Bitcoin developer toolkit. He is also the author of Cryptoeconomics, a comprehensive volume on Bitcoin principles. Eric will discuss the actual forces at work in Bitcoin - why it exists, how it works, and where it is going.

Please be aware that our venue has a very limited capacity. Please RSVP early and don't forget to update if you cannot make it.
