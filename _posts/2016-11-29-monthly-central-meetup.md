## Let's Talk About Bitcoin

Our monthly casual Bitcoin meetup in Central. Catch up with the crowd, enjoy a drink or snacks and catch up on blockchain drama.

Unfortunately we have to move this meetup one week ahead (November 29).
[We are also inviting you to join our Blockchain Holiday Party on December 7 at Metta.](/2016-12-blockchain-holiday-party/)
