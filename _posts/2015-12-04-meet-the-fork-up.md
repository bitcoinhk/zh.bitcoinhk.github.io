## Let's Meet The Fork Up

We had our very first Bitcoin meetup here at Red Bar in summer of 2012, and we are more than happy the way our community has grown and matured since then. We invite you all to the roof top of IFC mall for drinks and snacks and of course great chats. It's public space, feel free to bring your own drinks or food, or buy directly from Red Bar.

星期五晚上8點鐘香港比特幣協會邀請已經來到香港的朋友去國際金融中心商場天台的Red Bar外面碰面聊天認識一下本港的比特幣愛好者、因為是公共場所可以自帶酒水及食物或選擇在巴台買。
