### #15, October 26: Cryptocurrencies and Monetary Supply

Date: **October 26, 2016 19:00 - 21:00**     
Location: Tuspark Workhub, 23/F Island Beverly, **1 Great George Street, Causeway Bay**, Hong Kong     
(Around the corner from **Exit E, Causeway Bay Station**)     

The regulation of the monetary policy has traditionally been the sole prerogative of central banks. Inflation targeting and employment have been two major factors driving recent monetary policy. The introduction of cryptocurrencies raises the question of to what end should monetary supply be regulated.

Meanwhile, stablecoins and token economies have emerged along Bitcoin and Ether. Stablecoins are a class of crypto-assets designed to hold a stable value through various asset mechanisms. With the rapidly expanding world of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO's) and Token Launches, as well as increasing world of digitized assets (gold, real estate, music, etc) these stablecoins create gravity in space.
