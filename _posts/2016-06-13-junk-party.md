## Junk Boat Party - Our 100th Meetup!

It's been a shaky but pleasant ride over the past four years for our group and the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, in which we have organized almost one hundred talks, lectures, discussions and meetups.

For our 100th meetup we invite you to celebrate with us on a boat cruising around Victoria Harbour.
