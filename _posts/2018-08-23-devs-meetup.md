## Let's Talk About Code



The Bitcoin Devs meetup is a technical event intended for programmers, developers and technical people curious, interested and knowledgeable about the Bitcoin protocol to catch up, discuss and socialize.

Special guest: [**Larry Salibra**](https://twitter.com/larrysalibra/), engineering partner at [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/), will explain how to build a name system on top of Bitcoin.

The Blockstack Name System (BNS) is a replacement for DNS that runs as a layer 2 application on top of Bitcoin. Larry will cover the details of BNS, including its move from Namecoin and its implementation as a state machine on an underlying blockchain.

BNS finds application in identity and authentication, app discovery and multi-player storage.

Please be aware that our venue has a very limited capacity. Please RSVP early and don't forget to update if you cannot make it.
