Several of the attendees of this week's Inside Bitcoins conference will be taking a trip to
Macau to meet up with some Macau bitcoiners and members of the [Macau Digital Currency Association][1].

Macau has one of the densest Bitcoin atm networks in the world with 6 in the 12 square mile
territory and lots of great food and culture, so it's definitely worth the 60 minute
boat trip for any Bitcoiners visiting from out of town!

This is a last minute event and exact details (time & itinenary) are TDB, so please join the [Telegram
chat group][2] if you're interested in going.
