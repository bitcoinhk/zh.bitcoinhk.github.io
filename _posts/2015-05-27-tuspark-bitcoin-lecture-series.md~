### #3, June 23: Bitcoin Regulation (panel)
While Bitcoin remains 'unregulated' in Hong Kong, few understand what this term actually means. In other places the situation is far more confusing, creating frustration among those who feel barred from creating and investing in Bitcoin ideas. How does Bitcoin fit into the existing financial regulatory framework of Hong Kong, and how might this change in the future?

### #4, June 29: Smart Contracts (lecture)
Today's contracts are difficult enough to read for most humans, who barely skip through them even on the matter of life and death. How can contracts become smarter, machine readable and self-enforcable? Two talks explore what is possible today, and give an outlook more science than fiction.

**First lecture, Dr. Joseph Wang & Max Jackowski:**
Presenting a machine readable, legally enforcable contract that facilitates loans for small businesses cheaper and more flexible than any bank could. This contract is already used in a number of loans in Hong Kong today and ready to scale up for the emerging p2p (or rather, p2b) lending platforms.

- Max is a postgraduate student at the Faculty of Law at the University of Hong Kong. His research focuses on the relationship between the law and disruptive technologies. He has developed great interest in the subject of smart contracts as it provides for a novel and innovative way of understanding, analysing and enforcing the law

- Dr. Joseph Wang is investment banker and chief scientist for Bitquant
Research Laboratories (Asia) Limited, an applied research financial
technology laboratory.  He is using smart contracts to issue loans to
high-tech SME's in Hong Kong and is developing digital currency for
trade with Africa.  He claims to be the first person to use a smart
contract for a real world business transaction.

**Second lecture, Pindar Wong:**
While today's smart contracts still rely on our existing legal system for enforcement, future smart contracts will become self-executing, unforgeable and impossible to cheat on.

- Pindar Wong is the Chairman of VeriFi (Hong Kong) Ltd, a discrete Internet Financial Infrastructure consultancy. He is establishing the 'Smart Contracts Initiative' (SCI) based on networked accounting and open digital ledger technologies.  He is an active member of the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Payment Community Group. As a Commissioner on the Global Commission on Internet Governance, he is helping to articulate and advance a strategic vision for the future of Internet governance. He also serves on the Digital 21 Strategy Advisory Committee of the Hong Kong Government, the School of Engineering Advisory Committee HKUST and the Technical Advisory Board of the Packet Clearing House. Previously, he co-founded Hong Kong’s first licensed ISP in 1993, was the first Vice-Chairman of ICANN, Chairman of the Asia Pacific Internet Association, alternate Chairman of Asia Pacific Network Information Centre and elected Trustee of the Internet Society.

### #5, July 7: Bitcoin Startups (panel)
While Hong Kong is establishing itself as a hotbed for startups in Asia, Bitcoin startups come here to find a mixed climate of welcoming regulation, apathetic government and a repellent financial system.

### #6, October 14: Blockchain vs Bitcoin (panel)
"It's not about Bitcoin, it's about the underlying technology." While Bitcoin without doubt has had extraordinary success among all of the currently available blockchains, it suffers from a poor image, banks and regulators staying clear of it and internal conflicts about further innovation and direction. To what extend can other blockchains surpass Bitcoin? What are 'private blockchains', and what can we expect when banks are declaring they are 'exploring blockchain technology?'
Our panelists have a diverse background in finance and provide you with great insights and views into an emerging new economy.

Date: **October 14, 2015 19:00 - 21:00**
