If you want to buy ICOs and cryptos, you may need to get yourself some Ethereum. We will walk through MEW (MyEtherWallet), Etherdelta (decentralized exchange), and a few other tools like Etherscan to track your new cryptos.

Find out why Mastercard, Microsoft, JP Morgan, and over 100 other companies have joined the Ethereum Alliance. Enterprises in banking, management, consulting, automotive, pharmaceutical, health, technology, mobile, entertainment, and other industries will be building blockchains for the next 10 years. But will Ethereum be the one to rule them all?

We will talk about the Parity hack and weaknesses on the Ethereum chain. Ethereum Classic, and the new altcoins.

If you already know the basics, find out what to look for in future cryptos.
