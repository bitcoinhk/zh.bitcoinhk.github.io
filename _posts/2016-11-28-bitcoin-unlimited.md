With Bitcoin Unlimited currently holding 10% of the global hash rate and dominating the Bitcoin news cycle for their controversial stances on scaling, join us for an evening of presentations by their key developers and participate in a discussion which addresses key issues on SegWit, on-chain scaling and the future of the Bitcoin protocol development.

The presentation topics are as follows:
