Simon Edhouse of BitTunes will be in Hong Kong this weekend. Some bitcoiners will be meeting up in the public area outside of Red Bar on top of IFC Mall for some drinks and to chat about the future of bitcoin and music.

BitTunes is a music technology startup based in London which has created a music sharing & earning platform that monetizes the exchange of digital data as people share songs. Users can earn percentages of Bitcoin simply by buying and sharing music. Please note that the area we'll be meeting is outdoors and is public, so feel free to bring your own drinks and snacks.

If you have trouble finding the group, [message Quinn Lo (@quinnlo) via Telegram](https://telegram.me/quinnlo).
