### Tuspark Lecture Series: Smart Contracts

Today's contracts are difficult enough to read for most humans, who barely skip through them even on the matter of life and death. How can contracts become smarter, machine readable and self-enforcable? Two talks explore what is possible today, and give an outlook more science than fiction.

**First lecture, Dr. Joseph Wang & Max Jackowski:**
Presenting a machine readable, legally enforcable contract that facilitates loans for small businesses cheaper and more flexible than any bank could. This contract is already used in a number of loans in Hong Kong today and ready to scale up for the emerging p2p (or rather, p2b) lending platforms.

- Max is a postgraduate student at the Faculty of Law at the University of Hong Kong. His research focuses on the relationship between the law and disruptive technologies. He has developed great interest in the subject of smart contracts as it provides for a novel and innovative way of understanding, analysing and enforcing the law

- Dr. Joseph Wang is investment banker and chief scientist for Bitquant
Research Laboratories (Asia) Limited, an applied research financial
technology laboratory.  He is using smart contracts to issue loans to
high-tech SME's in Hong Kong and is developing digital currency for
trade with Africa.  He claims to be the first person to use a smart
contract for a real world business transaction.

**Second lecture, Pindar Wong:**
While today's smart contracts still rely on our existing legal system for enforcement, future smart contracts will become self-executing, unforgeable and impossible to cheat on.

- Pindar Wong is the Chairman of VeriFi (Hong Kong) Ltd, a discrete Internet Financial Infrastructure consultancy. He is establishing the 'Smart Contracts Initiative' (SCI) based on networked accounting and open digital ledger technologies.  He is an active member of the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Payment Community Group. As a Commissioner on the Global Commission on Internet Governance, he is helping to articulate and advance a strategic vision for the future of Internet governance. He also serves on the Digital 21 Strategy Advisory Committee of the Hong Kong Government, the School of Engineering Advisory Committee HKUST and the Technical Advisory Board of the Packet Clearing House. Previously, he co-founded Hong Kong’s first licensed ISP in 1993, was the first Vice-Chairman of ICANN, Chairman of the Asia Pacific Internet Association, alternate Chairman of Asia Pacific Network Information Centre and elected Trustee of the Internet Society.
