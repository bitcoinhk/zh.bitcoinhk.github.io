## Let's Talk About Code


Topic: Re-usable payment codes (BIP47). How do they work, how are they implemented?

Speaker: **Nik Blinkov** and **Ive Oparin** of [Billion App](https://billionapp.com/)

Re-usable payment codes were proposed in April 2015 by Justus Ranvier. Billion App is a privacy-focused mobile Bitcoin wallet that implemented this proposal. Nik and Ive will explain how BIP47 was adopted by Billion App and what is on the table as part of version 2 proposals.
